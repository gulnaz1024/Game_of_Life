# Game of life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Classical rules

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives.  
- Any dead cell with 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell.  
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## My own rules

- Any dead cell with 2 or 4 live neighbours becomes alive.  
- Any live cell with 5 live neighbours becomes a dead cell.  
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
